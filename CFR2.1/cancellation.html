		deadline (23:59 hrs UTC on 31st July 2017) will be subject to a 15% cancellation fee.
	</p>
	<p>
		Attendee registration cancellations received after the Early Bird deadline
		(23:59 hrs UTC on 31st July 2017) are non-refundable.  Late requests for refunds due
		to exceptional circumstances will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

	<p>
		All cancellations must be sent in writing via e-mail or regular mail to the user meeting
		organisers.

	<p>
		No exception will be made to the cancellation/refund policy for registrants due to

		earthquake, hurricane, volcano eruption, flood or terrorist attacks). The final
		decision on refunds rests with Dyalog Ltd.
